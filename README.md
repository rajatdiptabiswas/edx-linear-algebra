# Linear Algebra - Foundations to Frontiers

Exercises from the [Linear Algebra - Foundations to Frontiers](https://www.edx.org/course/linear-algebra-foundations-to-frontiers-2) course by [The University of Texas at Austin](https://www.utexas.edu/) on [edX](https://www.edx.org)

## Prerequisites
- [MATLAB](https://matlab.mathworks.com/) or [Octave](https://octave.org/)
- Code editor of choice *([Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/3))*

> **Note:** Personally, I used **Octave CLI** to solve problems and **Microsoft Visual Studio Code** to edit MATLAB files
